# Environment-Tagging

In industries like tourism, environmental monitoring, urban planning, and geographic information systems (GIS), there is a growing need to automatically tag and categorize large volumes of landscape images. Manual labeling is time-consuming and inconsistent, especially when dealing with image data collected from drones, satellites, or on-the-ground sources.

This project uses the Intel Image Classification dataset to train a deep learning model that can automatically classify landscape images into six real-world categories: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street.

By using FastAI and transfer learning, the project aims to demonstrate how quickly and effectively a reliable classifier can be built and used to support applications like:

**Automatic image tagging**

**Real-time camera feed analysis**

**Image organization and search**

**Environmental scene recognition in mobile or web apps**
